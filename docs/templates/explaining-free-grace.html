    <h1>Explaining Free Grace</h1>
    All Free Grace holds to certain core teachings, most Free Grace align with other
    teachings and there are teachings where Free Grace is diverse. The aim of this article is not to provide a defence of Free Grace
    or of a particular understanding within Free Grace but to give an in depth explanation about the landscape of Free Grace.

    <h2>What is Free Grace?</h2>
    Free Grace is a soteriological view which defines the order of salvation as following:
    <ol>
        <li>An unbeliever comes to faith.</li>
        <li>The unbelievers then receives Eternal Life.</li>
        <li>The unbeliever can never lose his Eternal Life, no matter what follows.</li>
    </ol>

    Faith is hereby defined as explicitly not containing an commitment on the side of the unbeliever. There also is no
    turning from sin towards Jesus included. As for the Eternal Life it is understood that this can never be lost, no matter
    if e.g. the person who came to faith afterward abandons Christianity.
