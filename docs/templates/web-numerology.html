    <h1>The Mathematical "Perfection" of the World English Bible</h1>
    
    <div class="satire-notice" style="background: rgba(210, 153, 34, 0.15); border: 1px solid rgba(210, 153, 34, 0.4); color: #e3b341; padding: 1rem; border-radius: 6px; margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 0.9rem;">
        <strong>Editor's Note:</strong> This article is a satirical demonstration. By applying the same numerological methods used by "KJV Only" proponents, we prove that the World English Bible (WEB) is also "mathematically perfect." The goal is not to elevate the WEB, but to expose the flaw in using data dredging as an apologetic tool.
    </div>

    <h2>The Argument from Numbers</h2>
    <p>
        For decades, a subset of Christian apologetics has argued that the King James Version (KJV) is the only inspired Bible because of "hidden numerical patterns." Proponents like Ivan Panin and modern YouTube numerologists point to word counts, Gematria (letter values), and verse structures that are divisible by 7 or other "holy numbers."
    </p>
    <p>
        Their logic is seductive: <em>"No human mind could have orchestrated these patterns across 66 books. Therefore, the text must be divinely dictated, down to the very letter."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        But is this phenomenon unique to the KJV? Or is it simply a result of the Law of Large Numbers—that if you look for enough patterns in a massive dataset, you are guaranteed to find them?
    </p>
    <p>
        To test this, we ran a "Deep Grind" analysis on the <strong>World English Bible (WEB)</strong>, a modern Public Domain translation. The results were shocking. If math proves divinity, then the WEB is undeniable.
    </p>

    <h2>The Miracle of the 153</h2>
    <p>
        In John 21:11, the disciples catch exactly <strong>153 fish</strong>. This number has fascinated theologians for centuries. Augustine believed it represented the "fullness of the Church" gathered from the nations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Critics of the WEB might be surprised to learn that the Holy Spirit seemingly stamped this number on the very structure of the translation.
    </p>

    <div class="miracle-card" style="background: #0d1117; border: 1px solid #30363d; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #58a6ff;">The Ephesian Catch</h3>
        <p>Which New Testament letter is the primary theological treatise on the nature of the Church? <strong>Ephesians</strong>.</p>
        <p>In the World English Bible, the Book of Ephesians contains exactly <strong>153 verses</strong>.</p>
        <p>A perfect match. The number of the fish (the Church) matches the book of the Church.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="miracle-card" style="background: #0d1117; border: 1px solid #30363d; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0; color: #58a6ff;">The Gospel Seal</h3>
        <p>The number of the fish (153) appears again in the Gospels. In the four accounts of Christ's life (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John), the name <strong>"Jesus"</strong> appears exactly <strong>612 times</strong>.</p>
        <p>What is 612?</p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #e6edf3;">4 × 153 = 612</p>
        <p>Four Gospels. Four portraits. Multiplied by the number of the harvest. The probability of this happening by chance is astronomical.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Mark of Perfection</h2>
    <p>
        The number <strong>7</strong> is the biblical number of perfection. The number <strong>100</strong> represents fullness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider the Gospel of Mark. It is often called the "Action Gospel," portraying Jesus as the suffering servant. In the World English Bible, the Gospel of Mark contains exactly <strong>700 verses</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7 × 100</strong>. Perfect fullness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the Book of Acts—the history of the Apostles—contains exactly <strong>1008 verses</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7 × 144</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        144 is the number of the elect (12 tribes × 12 apostles). Acts describes the spreading of the Gospel to the elect. The math is precise.
    </p>

    <h2>The Sevenfold Revelation</h2>
    <p>
        The Book of Revelation is structured around sevens: seven churches, seven seals, seven trumpets. But in the WEB, this structure extends into the very vocabulary of the text.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following words appear exactly <strong>7 times</strong> in the Book of Revelation:
    </p>
    <ul style="columns: 2; -webkit-columns: 2; -moz-columns: 2;">
        <li><strong>Prophecy</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spirits</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Servants</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Satan</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Abyss</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Sickle</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Earthquake</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bowl</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Even the phrase <em>"Spirit says"</em> appears exactly 7 times.
    </p>

    <h2>The Geometric Christ</h2>
    <p>
        Using the standard rules of English Gematria (where A=6, B=12, C=18...), we find "divine signatures" hidden in the names of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        The word <strong>Lord</strong> sums to <strong>294</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        294 is <strong>7 × 42</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Matthew 1, there were <strong>42 generations</strong> from Abraham to Christ. The very name "Lord" encodes the genealogy of the Messiah.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using Simple Gematria (A=1, B=2...), the name <strong>Christ</strong> sums to <strong>77</strong>. Double perfection.
    </p>

    <h2>The Verdict: Data Dredging</h2>
    <p>
        So, is the World English Bible the only inspired translation? Did the translators consciously count the word "Earthquake" in Revelation to ensure it appeared 7 times?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>No.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        What you have just seen is a demonstration of the <strong>Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy</strong>. If you shoot a thousand bullets at the side of a barn, you can walk up afterwards, draw a target around the tightest cluster of bullet holes, and claim you are a master marksman.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Bible contains hundreds of thousands of words and verses. By checking for divisibility by 7, 12, 40, 153, or 666, and by checking counts in the Whole Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Gospels, or individual books, we generate millions of potential data points.
    </p>
    <p>
        Statistically, "miracles" are inevitable.
