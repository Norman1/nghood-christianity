    <h1>Why &ldquo;Homosexuality&rdquo; Misleads Christian Ethics</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            The catch-all word <em>homosexuality</em> merges three different realities:
            <strong>same-sex attraction</strong>, <strong>same-sex sexual behavior</strong>,
            and <strong>gay-lesbian identity</strong>. When this umbrella term is applied to biblical ethics, it distorts the actual teaching of Scripture.
        </p>



    <h2>What the word covers today</h2>
    <p>Modern reference works routinely bundle attraction, behavior and often identity as well.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Merriam-Webster</strong>: defines homosexuality as both &ldquo;sexual or romantic attraction&rdquo; to the same sex and &ldquo;sexual activity&rdquo; with someone of the same sex; see the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homosexuality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merriam-Webster entry</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>APA bias-free language guide</strong>: treats sexual orientation as a component of <strong>identity</strong> while explicitly referencing &ldquo;behavior and/or social affiliation&rdquo; in its <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/sexual-orientation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bias-free language guidance</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As a native German speaker, I was first surprised by the addition of <em>behavior</em> in English definitions. However, the <a href="https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Homosexualitaet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duden</a> entry also includes behavior, so I stand corrected in my initial assumption that the term would not include behavior in German. A quick search in other languages like Spanish reveals that in them the term deals merely with the attraction aspect (see the <a href="https://dle.rae.es/homosexualidad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diccionario de la lengua espa&ntilde;ola</a>). All in all, homosexuality is an imprecise, confusing umbrella term.</p>


    <h2>Where the term came from</h2>
    <p>The word <em>homosexuality</em> (German:
    <em>Homosexualit&auml;t</em>) first appeared in an anonymous German pamphlet in 1869, a shift documented in
    <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3913702/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herzer's historical survey (PubMed)</a>.
    The term was coined to replace existing labels that focused on behavior with a new label centered on attraction. In other words, it was a deliberate shift in language by a homosexual-rights activist to move attention away from behavior and toward attraction.
    When Christians now proclaim fire and brimstone against homosexuality, this is not without a certain irony, since they insert a term coined by a homosexual-rights activist
    into their own understanding of Scripture.</p>
    <p>While &ldquo;homosexuality&rdquo; was initially coined as a neutral descriptor for sexual orientation it later underwent a semantic shift to the meaning it carries today.</p>

    <h2>What the Bible actually teaches</h2>
    <p>
        The Bible never deals with the umbrella term <em>homosexuality</em> but focuses solely on the prohibited behavioral aspect.

    <div class="scripture-quote compact">
        <blockquote>Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable.</blockquote>
        <cite>Leviticus 18:22 (NIV)</cite>
    </div>
    <div class="scripture-quote">
        <blockquote>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations
            for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust
            for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.</blockquote>
        <cite>Romans 1:26-27 (NIV)</cite>
    </div>
    <div class="scripture-quote">
        <blockquote>Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually
            immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor
            slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</blockquote>
        <cite>1 Corinthians 6:9-10 (NIV)</cite>
    </div>

    <p>Sadly, in 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 some translations like the NASB render the phrase as &ldquo;homosexuals,&rdquo; which is inaccurate. However, the NASB
    clarifies in a footnote that the text actually describes both the
    dominant active part (arsenokoítai) and the passive part (malakoí) in a homosexual relationship of the given cultural context.</p>

    <h2>Homosexuality in other sources</h2>
    For historical context from early Christian writers, see this set of excerpts from so-called church fathers that focus squarely on behavior rather than attraction:
    <a href="https://www.christian-history.org/homosexuality-quotes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">christian-history.org/homosexuality-quotes.html</a>.
    Within Judaism, there generally is also a distinction between behavior and attraction. See this representative dialogue on
    <a href="https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7619/what-does-judaism-think-about-homosexuality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judaism.StackExchange</a>.

    <h2>Outlook</h2>
    I first thought that Christians who talk broadly about homosexuality were merely inaccurate. But after listening to quite a few Christians discuss this topic,
    I have become increasingly convinced that the introduction of this imprecise language into Christian teaching is a direct attack on Christianity.
    Getting caught in an embarrassing situation, I still have the option to be victorious by not lying my way out of it. For every temptation there is a path of victory.
    But that term ostracizes its victims by creating a new sin over which there is no victory.
