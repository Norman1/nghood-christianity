Fruchtenbaum Very little of Ariel’s Harmony of the Gospels originated with me; it is largely based on the harmony of A. T. Robertson,[1] which in turn was based on a previous harmony by John A. Broadus. But there are some differences: First, where more than one Gospel is listed, the verses will be placed in parallel columns, as in A. T. Robertson’s harmony. The one difference is that whereas the first column in his harmony was Mark, reflecting Robertson’s view of a Markan priority, this work will follow the present New Testament order of the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. <<<PAGE 31>>> Second, Robertson largely followed a geographical approach, whereas I have chosen a thematic approach. The advantage of a thematic approach is that correlations can be seen between a teaching and an event, and vice versa. Therefore, this approach provides a better overall picture as to how things in the life of the Messiah were related to each other. The significance of details which may have seemed to be casually mentioned becomes clear. Third, I follow Luke’s order of events, as did Robertson, but in those places where Robertson chose to deviate from that Gospel, this harmony will continue to follow Luke’s order. Fourth, the division titles largely, but not exclusively, follow the outline of J. <<<PAGE 32>>> Dwight Pentecost that was handed out to his students at Dallas Theological Seminary.[2] The translation used in this work is the American Standard Version of 1901. However, the archaic language (e.g., thee, thou, hast, wast, etc.) has been modernized. One exception is the pronoun you. In modern English, you is used as both a singular and plural second person pronoun. Therefore, to more accurately translate the original Greek text, the archaic second person plural pronoun ye has been retained in the Scripture quotations. Furthermore, the reader will find the names of persons and places transliterated in accordance with Hebrew pronunciation. An index with the most important names can be found on the next page. <<<PAGE 33>>> Index of Names This harmony of the Gospels uses the Hebrew names of the people and places mentioned in the accounts, albeit in a transliterated form. This index contains the names of the most important persons and leaves out those that are only mentioned in Matthew’s and Luke’s genealogies.
